    bio: `After working for more than a decade in other sectors, I decided to dedicate myself professionally to my true passion, web development. I am in love with technology and I like to be able to create different solutions that really serve people and add value. In my experience, what distinguishes a good job from a great job is having understood the need and responding to expectations.
    My spectrum of skills includes both front-end and back-end building and for this I use the latest technologies in the world of web development.`,
