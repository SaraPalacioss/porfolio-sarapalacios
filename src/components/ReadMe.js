        After working for more than 10 years in other sectors, I have decided to
        dedicate myself professionally to my true passion, web development. I am
        in love with technology and I like being able to create different
        solutions that really serve people and add value. In my experience, what
        distinguishes a good job from a great job is having understood the need
        and responding to expectations. My spectrum of skills includes both
        front-end and back-end creation and, for this, I use the latest
        technologies in the world of web development (ReactJS, NodeJS,
        ExpressJS, MongoDB among others).
